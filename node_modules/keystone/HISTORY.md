## v0.2.0 / 2014-01-26

A bumper release for the new year! We've moved to v0.2.x because some packages have been updated to new minor versions that may cause compatibility issues, specifically:

KeystoneJS now requires mongoose 3.8.5+. Please test compatibility with your application before deploying this update to production.

This version also requires Jade 1.x, which includes some breaking changes from the 0.x branch, particularly to doctype definition. Updating your app should be simple, but again, be sure to test before deploying to production.

One of the other big changes in this release is the work done by [Iulian Meghea](https://github.com/iulian-meghea) breaking up all the field templates into individual files, in preparation for introducing field type plugins in the future.
